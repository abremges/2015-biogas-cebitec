# 2015-biogas-cebitec

Work in progress, to be finished asap!

### Data for review

In the folder [raw_data](raw_data), you can find the following files:

a | b | c
--- | --- | ---
d | e | f

These data will be submitted to GigaDB eventually.

### Availablility

Here, I will provide a description of the raw data, available from ENA.

g | h | i
--- | --- | ---
j | k | l

### Reproducibility

Please take a look at the [Makefile](Makefile). It downloads all data and re-runs all steps to reproduce my results (excluding the KEGG analyses, unfortunately). [@pbelmann](https://github.com/pbelmann) implemented and tested the accompanying Docker container. I will add more information soon.

If you have any questions or run into problems, please file an [issue](https://github.com/abremges/2015-biogas-cebitec/issues)!

### The manuscript

In the folder [latex_src](latex_src), you can find the [manuscript's draft](latex_src/bremges_gigascience_2015.pdf) along with all LaTex source files and figures.
